      <summary>What is a definition in HTML?</summary>

      <p>
        A Definition List in HTML is used to represent a list of terms along
        with their corresponding descriptions or definitions. The Definition
        List is created using the (Definition List) element, which wraps around
        one or more pairs of (Definition Term) and (Definition Description)
        elements.

        What is the purpose of the (details) and (summary) elements in HTML?
      </summary>

      <p>
        The (details) and (summary) elements in HTML are used to create
        interactive disclosure widgets that allow users to toggle the visibility
        of additional content. The (details) element acts as a container for the
        content that can be shown or hidden, while the (summary) element
        provides a summary or title for the content within the (details)
        element. When the user clicks on the (summary), it expands or collapses
        the content inside the (details).
